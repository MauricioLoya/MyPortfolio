## About the Project

This project served as an outstanding opportunity to showcase my technical prowess through a test designed to integrate a public REST API with a frontend framework. I chose to utilize Vue in its version 3, embracing some of its cutting-edge features such as the [setup script](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) and [generics](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#generics) in the props of my components.

For the application state management, I implemented Pinia, a modern and efficient solution that significantly simplifies the handling of the store, aligning with contemporary web development practices.

This endeavor provided a platform to demonstrate my proficiency and versatility with Vue, including its latest features. The final outcome not only reflects my technical knowledge but also my ability to adapt to new technologies and tools.

For a comprehensive demonstration of my capabilities and to explore the final product of this technical test, I invite you to visit the following links:
