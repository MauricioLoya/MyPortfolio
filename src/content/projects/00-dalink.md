## About my project

This project is entirely mine; it's my domain, which I planned and designed from scratch. My goal was to create a project that would allow me to implement Next.js's new features, such as App Router, React Server Components (RSC), and Server Actions, which truly blew my mind.

For user authentication, I opted to use the NextAuth.js library. Then, I set up a project in the Google Cloud Console to manage user authentication effectively.

Regarding the database, I chose PostgreSQL, which I integrated directly within the Next.js environment. What started as a simple project gradually scaled up to become a fully functional production app.

For deployment, I turned to Vercel along with GitHub, which facilitated an efficient and hassle-free CI/CD process. I hosted the database on a service called Nano, perfectly complementing my project's infrastructure.
