## About the project

I frequently use an app for Mac called [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), described by its creators as "Supercharged productivity," and honestly, I believe them. I've gotten a lot of value out of it and see no reason not to install it.

I realized that it was possible to make an extension for the app, and I wanted to achieve something feasible. So, using the CoinGecko REST API, I made a crypto coin searcher/querier.

React is used to create the extension, along with all the necessary components and libraries provided by Raycast's library.
