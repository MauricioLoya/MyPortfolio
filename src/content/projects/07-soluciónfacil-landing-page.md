## About the project

In another project with Digital Connect, I worked on the website for a company that provided financial services. With my prior experience in Astro, I ventured to propose the addition of a blog to the website, using Astro Content to efficiently manage and deploy the blog content for the company.

For this project, we continued to leverage our technology stack of Netlify and GitHub for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). This combination of tools has allowed us to maintain an agile and efficient workflow, ensuring swift updates and deployments of the website, which is crucial for maintaining content relevance and freshness in the dynamic financial services sector.
