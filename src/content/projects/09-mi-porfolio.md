## About the project

For my portfolio, I was looking for a lightweight solution with great SEO capabilities. Between Next.js and Nuxt.js, I ultimately decided on Astro due to its shorter learning curve. Astro stood out as the ideal choice for quickly developing an efficient website that's well-optimized for search engines.

For deployment, I turned to services like Netlify, which greatly eased the project's implementation. The integration with GitHub, along with Netlify's Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) capabilities, streamlined the process of updating and maintaining the site. This tool not only expedited the deployment but also allowed me to link the site with my domain, ensuring a professional presentation of my work.
