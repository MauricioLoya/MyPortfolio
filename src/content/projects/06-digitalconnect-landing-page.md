## About the project

I partnered with a marketing agency to collaborate on creating landing pages, leveraging my expertise in Astro and its potential for achieving good SEO positioning. As a starting point, I developed their landing page and set up a payment gateway with Stripe, which is currently disabled as the pricing for their service packages is being finalized.

For Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), I chose to use the tools provided by GitHub and Netlify. The free tier offered by Netlify is particularly beneficial, allowing me to host a large number of projects without significant restrictions. Additionally, assigning and managing the domain proved to be a straightforward and efficient process, thus facilitating the seamless launch and ongoing updates of the developed sites.
