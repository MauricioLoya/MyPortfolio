## Todo Application - MEAN Stack

This is a **full-stack Todo application** built using the **MEAN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), designed to manage tasks efficiently with a modern, responsive interface.

## Key Highlights:
- **Frontend:** Developed with **Angular**, featuring a dynamic and responsive UI built using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, user-friendly experience.
- **Backend:** Created with **Node.js** and fully written in **TypeScript**, ensuring robust, type-safe code for scalability and maintainability.
- **Database:** The app integrates with **MongoDB** to store and manage task data efficiently, handling real-time CRUD operations.
- **REST API:** The backend exposes a comprehensive RESTful API that handles all task-related operations, allowing seamless communication with the frontend.

## Features:
- **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- **TypeScript-First Backend:** Improved code maintainability and reduced errors.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring that the UI adapts to any device.

## Why This Project Stands Out:
This project showcases my ability to **build full-stack applications from scratch**, from backend architecture to creating a polished user interface. By using **TypeScript** and **MongoDB**, I've implemented a solution that is both powerful and scalable. The clean, responsive design demonstrates my attention to detail in UX/UI, making it ideal for real-world use cases.
