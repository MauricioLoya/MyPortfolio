## About the project

While I can't disclose much about it due to my commitment to the project's confidentiality, I can share that it was an initiative in which I employed Nuxt and Tailwind CSS. For fetching information from the backend, I chose to use GraphQL, a choice that allowed me to handle data requests more efficiently and systematically.

Given the critical requirement to ensure excellent search engine ranking for the page, the decision was made to use [NuxtJS 3](https://nuxt.com/). This technology was specifically selected to leverage the advantages offered by Server-Side Rendering (SSR). SSR not only enhances page performance and loading speed but also significantly contributes to better indexing by search engines, a crucial aspect for achieving our online visibility and accessibility goals.
